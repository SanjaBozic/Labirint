## Game for small children,
### Made in UPBGE 0.2.3

Game in which small children choose what to drive (a car or a truck) and ride it into a maze. Each vehicle
had 4 levels to pass (4 mazes). Each maze is harder then the last. At the top left corner of the screen there
are arrows which show up depending which arrow key the player presses.

UPBGE is an open-source 3D game engine forked from old Blender Game Engine, deployed with Blender itself.

The game is in Croatian language.
